# MinMax Algorithm With Tic Tac Toe

The following code is an attempt at using C++ to code up a bot which plays the game of Tic-Tac-Toe with a player using the MinMax algorithm. This attempt was mostly made to practice my C++ skills.

## The Algorithm

The **MinMax** Algorithm is an algorithm that employs backtracking to select the optimal decision/move to make in a turn-based game with n players. In this case, Tic Tac Toe is a simple turn based game
with n=2 players.
